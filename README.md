# Hangman-Game
## Project Overview
This is a simple command-line version of the classic Hangman game. The game selects a word randomly from a predefined list of words, and the player attempts to guess the word by guessing one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of attempts (tries) to guess the word correctly.

## How to Play
<ul>The game randomly selects a word from the predefined list.</ul>
<ul>The player is shown the word in the form of underscores (one for each letter).</ul>
<ul>The player has 5 tries to guess the word by entering one letter at a time.</ul>
<ul>If the guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in the word. If incorrect, the number of remaining tries is decremented.</ul>
<ul>The game continues until the player either guesses the entire word or runs out of tries.</ul>
<ul>A message is displayed indicating whether the player has won or lost.</ul>
